## QUIZ SHOW

Jeopardy style quiz games are favorites for creating excitement and educational 
instruction at the same time. 

The idea behind the game is simple, but sometimes finding a device that will
perform the "first to respond" lockout function can be problematic.

With this program is possibile controll 4 industrial buttons.
In order to indicate who have pressed first the button we use 4 RGB over the board and a WS2811
LED Matrix for show the result to the people.
Each button have a refered colour (Red, Green, Blue and Yellow), so the Led and the Matrix show
the order of the clours by the order of the reservation.
